# Health-Tracker
 A web application that helps users track their health and fitness goals.
Fitness Tracking: Log workouts (exercise type, duration, intensity).
Nutrition Tracking: Record meals and track calorie intake.
Goal Setting: Set and monitor health goals (weight, muscle gain, steps).
Data Visualization: Display progress with charts and trends.
Reminders: Send alerts for workouts, meals, hydration.
Community: Connect users to share progress and achievements.
This project could use tech like React/Vue.js (front-end), Node.js/Django (back-end), and integrate fitness APIs for data sync.
